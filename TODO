FireTPL v1.0.0

	- Better condition support. :if $bla == "blubb" && $isSuperBlubb
	- Ignore empty lines after string blocks and tags

	- i18n support
	- inline functions
	- inline html

	- Better parser (For .fire and .hbs support)
	
	- Rename special vars. Maybe to $$parent, $$root
	- Each helper add $first, $last, $odd
	- Handlebars syntax support (convert hbs2fire and parse it then)
	- RUPAR (Render Append Prepend Update Remove) support in FireTPL (Maybe with DOM watcher)


Bugs:

	- Set view path to load views fromsubdirs ( views/test/test.fire  => test/test )
	- Detailed error message
	- Log errors as errors, add error links to errors
	- Ignore missing objects. data = undefined; data.description triggers an exception.
	  This isn't optimal. FireTPL shouldn't trigger an exception. It should log a detailed error report.
	 - Parse h1 "Hello $name"
